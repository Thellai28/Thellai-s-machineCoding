Question was to build an Employee record management app with 5 tasks to be executed
to qualify the round.

we can hard code the employee records in any data structure of our choice.
Columns of the table are: EmpName, Age, Designation, Department, ReportingTo

Task 1: Display all the Employee records in a table format.
Task 2: Search records based on user give criteria.(this task is divided into two
sub tasks)
	a. display option according to the column type
	    1.String – Equals, Notequals,Contains, Notcontains, startswith, endswith
	    2.Integer- <, >, =, !=, between.
	b. apply the same for multiple conditions using ‘AND’ for each condition. (similar
	to ‘where’ class in SQL using multiple columns).
Task 3: print reporting tree of the given employee.
Task 4: print the employees reporting to the given manager.
Task 5: print summary of Department, Designation, ReportingTo.(menu driven)
